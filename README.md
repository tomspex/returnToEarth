<h1>Return to Earth</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This is my small project about getting back to Earth after the events of Portal 2.
You play as the character "Wheatley" from said game.</p>

<p>The project was originally coded in Python with the PyGame library, 
but I decided to port it to C++ with SDL2 for fun.</p>

<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<p>I did all the development in VSCode on macOS Ventura and used brew to install the libraries needed.
I didn't include the dependencies in this repository. You'll have to find them elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Current State</h3>
<p>The game currently has movement, sprites, music, sounds, scrolling cubes, a scrolling star background,
a gameover screen, a score-health-objective system with a small UI, an NPC of the Space Core, and a restart button.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>I want to add levels and perhaps an end sequence in the future. I'll think of more goals later.</p>
